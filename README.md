# AntFarm-Life-GameDownload-
This is a game I created.
Even though I'm very noob at programming, I like to create games! The app I used (GBStudio) had some bugs, but some of them were also because of me. Therefore, the game is far from beeing fine. However, I'll just leave it here so y'all can download it if you want (I don't know why you'd do it, but ok!).
I'm leaving some of the older updates I made just for you to play them if you want.
To play the game, you need to download the 3 files from the folder of each update. Ex.: "AntFarm Life 25-01-2021 update" is the folder. You download the 3 files in it (the "game.gb" file, the "game.map" file and the "game.sym" file) and install a GameBoy or GameBoy Color emulator (better experience with GBColor emulator). Then open the emulator and choose the "game.gb" file.
I hope you enjoy and bye!
